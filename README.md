> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Malbox is still in a very early stage of development, currently, the platform as is, isn't ready to be utilized.
> There are still a lot of rough edges, the code is for the most part not refactored/optimized, and all features described

# Overview

Malbox is an open-source malware analysis platform designed to provide security researchers, malware analysts, and cybersecurity teams with a powerful, extensible environment for analyzing files and understanding their behavior. 

## Why Malbox?

- **Plugin Architecture**: Extend functionality easily through plugins, which can be written in Rust, Javascript and Python.
- **User-friendly Ecosystem**: The Malbox built-in marketplace makes it easy to install official and community verified plugins. Installation does not require rebuilding or restarting Malbox. Plugins and profiles follow strict standards to ensure a healthy, thriving ecosystem.
- **Cloud or On-Premise Storage and Deployment**: Malbox supports both cloud-based and on-premise solutions for your infrastructure and storage needs.
- **Easy Setup**: Enjoy a user-friendly, minimal-overhead setup that is ready to use within minutes. Malbox emphasizes declarative configuration to reduce complexity and simplify the setup and configuration process.

# Plugin Ecosystem

At the core of Malbox is its extensible plugin system, designed for analysis flexibility while maintaining process isolation. Plugins operate with a well-defined lifecycle and communication framework that enables seamless integration of new capabilities, sharing data between plugins without any duplication, and much more.

Plugins are discoverable via metadata, which defines their capabilities, requirements, and compatibility with other plugins. This allows for creating comprehensive analysis profiles that combine multiple plugins for in-depth examination of artifacts.
